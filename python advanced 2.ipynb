    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "answer-Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes. Modules are about functions. You dont instantiate modules(e.g. Math module) you just use methods in them.Module is like library of methods. \n",
    "Classes are about objects; it can hold its state (by keeping track of instance variables) and be duplicated as many times as you want. "

It binds the attributes with the given arguments.The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on."
